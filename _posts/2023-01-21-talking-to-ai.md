I bring to you a hiring event, learning to talk AI, and career options with ecommerce.

Hello Hello!

Today I bring to you a [hiring event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/career-fair-exclusive-tech-hiring-event-new-tickets-available-tickets-63049080497), [learning to talk AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZsJbYIFCCw), and [career options with ecommerce](https://blog.devmoek.com/shopify-full-guide).

1.  [**Tech Hiring Event**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/career-fair-exclusive-tech-hiring-event-new-tickets-available-tickets-63049080497)

    🎟️ I came across this online event that will take place Feb 17\. I don't know the organization, so I cannot vouch for it. But it looks like an interesting opportunity to expose yourself in case you are already out of school and in the market **looking for a job**, or a new job.  

    Registration is free, but it doesn't mean that you will participate. They seem to have a pre-selection process to fit candidates with potential employers.  

    If you are looking for fulltime opportunities, I think it is worth exploring.

    🗣️ With AI becoming more and more pervasive, what is there for us, human coders, to do? To build our own AI is very expensive. To understand the details behind is very difficult.  

    To learn how to better use is generally what is left. Don't get me wrong, it is very beneficial. And we better learn how to use it well.  

    The same way that there is a certain skill to asking good questions on Google, there is a skill to be learned to **get the most out of AI**.  

    Comes "Prompting". Some call it "Prompt Programming" or "Prompt Engineering".  

    This is a link to a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZsJbYIFCCw) to give you a general idea about what prompting is and here is an entire [free course](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intro) on the topic.  

    This will open your mind on how to best surf 🏄 this new technology wave 🌊.[

3.  [**Learning Shopify**](https://blog.devmoek.com/shopify-full-guide)

    🛒 Did you know that Shopify is the [biggest tech company in Canada](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/082615/5-biggest-canadian-software-companies.asp) and in the [top 10 biggest companies in general](https://companiesmarketcap.com/canada/largest-companies-in-canada-by-market-cap/)?  

    The tech industry provides so many different career options for us. It can be overwhelming. But variety is positive. It means that people with different interests can explore different career paths.  

    This link gives a good perspective on **how to work with Shopify** and what is involved. Not that you will change your path, but it is good to know about the possibilities.  

    For example: did you know that Shopify has its own template language called "[Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid)"?  

**My personal update:**

*   🎙️ **The interview with Jon Skeet** went very well! He was super friendly and open. He is one of the top 3 Stack Overflow contributors of all times. I will be releasing the podcast and raw video in the next few days.

*   🏂 **Going skiing today** with my younger daughter. I will be taking a lesson before. Wish me luck. Let's see how this will go 🥶.

*   ✍️ Still writing everyday for the book but I feel a bit stuck and not pleased with the depth of some of the topics. Let me tell you: **writing is such struggle 😞 for me**.
