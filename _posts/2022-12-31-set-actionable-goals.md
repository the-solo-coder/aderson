Today I bring to you links about **career**, how to **create a tree view with CSS** and how to **set action-driven goals** for 2023.

1.  [**What is a Developer Advocate?**](https://blog.securitylevelup.eu/why-developer-advocacy-matters)

    üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è There are so many different roles, titles and opportunities in the tech space. We are not even aware of all the options out there. Developer Advocate is one of those. Up to a few years ago I was not sure of what this role meant. What does this type of job entails?

    This blog post features the 3-year journey of Mike Elissen as a **developer advocate and he explains what it is as well**.

    This is a role I have never played before but I hope I can still do it in the future. Maybe it is something that you can consider too.

2.  [**Building a tree view in CSS**](https://iamkate.com/code/tree-views/)

    üå≥ Do you think you know a thing or two about HTML/CSS? How about you add to your toolbelt **how to create a tree view** out of UL lists with the help of CSS.

    This article shows how to build an accessible tree view using CSS. The results are so good. It looks amazingly professional.[

3.  [**Focus on what you can control**](https://nesslabs.com/actionable-goals)

    üèπ It is that time of the year again. We count our blessing from the year that is departing. What worked and what didn't.

    Then some of us plan. We set goals for the next year. It is a valid exercise even if most of us wouldn't be able to fulfil them. It is not about the destination, but the journey.

    This article talks about settings actions that we can control that will move us closer to achieving the goals we set.

    **For example:** I have the goal to have more newsletter subscribers. But I cannot control if you subscribe or not to this newsletter. However, what I can control is my output. I can control to be consistent with my newsletter. To bring topics that are of your interest. To do promotions that can lead to more subscribers. I can control all of these because they depend exclusively on my actions, my output.

    Whether it will result in more subscribes or not, it is up to be seen. But I'm doing my part. I'm doing what I can control.

    I would challenge you to look at your goals from similar lens. **What can you do that is under your complete control that will help you to get there?**

**My personal update:**

- ‚úÖ **My holiday week was not as productive as I was hoping**. I had grandiose plans to make some major decisions about my career and goals for 2023\. In short I still have the same goal as before: Writing the book.

- ‚úçÔ∏è More and more **I feel need to write**. Not only the book, but in a blog format. I have experimented with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) in the last few days as part of my break week. It is a static website generator that works very well with GitHub. Any one can build a GitHub blog with it. I will bring more things on this in a future newsletter, including the eventual blog that I will be starting... tomorrowüôÇ

- üçΩÔ∏è Having **New Year's Eve dinner** with the kids @ [Medieval Times](https://www.medievaltimes.com/). I hope it goes better than the one from [Cable Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPu6sQ9l4g)

- üì∞ Looking back at 2022, I'm glad I have started this newsletter and **I'm thankful to have you around**. I have ideas to keep it interesting for you and I hope you stick around during 2023.
