This is my blog where I express and experiment with ideas about code, career, education, and productivity.

I usually have a lot to say about many things, but I know very little about anything, so fell free to move on to someone else less verbose and wiser.

If you want to get in touch: aderson [dot] oliveira [at] gmail [dot] com 

Cheers,
Aderson
